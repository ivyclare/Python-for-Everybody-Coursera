# Python-for-Everybody-Coursera

The Python for Everybody course on coursera introduced fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, the technologies learned throughout the Specialization were used to design and create my own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization. The course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

This repo contains all my assignments throughout the course.
