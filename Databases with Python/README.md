## About The Course
This course introduces students to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well 
as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. 
The course uses SQLite3 as its database. We also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and 
visualization processes. We use the D3.js library to do basic data visualization.
