## About The Course
In the capstone, students build a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python.  
The projects involve all the elements of the specialization.  In the first part of the capstone, students
do some visualizations to become familiar with the technologies in use and then pursue their own project to visualize some other data that they have or can find.
